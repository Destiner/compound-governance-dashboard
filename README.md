# Compound Governance Dashboard

An app to keep track of Compound governance process, currently for Ropsten.

1. System parameters: govern-able parameters for each of the contract.
2. Changelog: list of proposals, with their statuses and proposed changes.

Fetches data from the blockchain.

## TODO

- [ ] voters page (balances + delegations)
- [ ] filter by proposal status (e.g. show only executed)
- [ ] port to mainnet
- [ ] use Compound Governance API to fetch account + proposal metadata
